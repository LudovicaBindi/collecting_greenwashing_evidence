# Description
This repository is one of the products of the thesis called "Designing a semi-automated approach to find potential evidence of corporate greenwashing" that I conducted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering and Policy Analysis at Delft University of Technology. This thesis was publicly defended on January 16, 2024.

This repository contains the data that my thesis was based on and that was produced. Moreover, codes and files that were used to elaborate the original data and produce results are also shared. The thesis report is also shared in this repository along with the a PowerPoint presentation about it that was used to defend this thesis.

# How to use
The repository is divided in two parts:
* Approach: this part contains the sources that describe the approach created. This folder is further divided in three: "1 - Communication" and "2 - Lobbying" which describe the two respective parts of the approach and "3 - Greenwashing table" which describes how to present the final results to allow for a greenwashing appraisal.
* Demonstration: this folder contains the demonstration results of the use of the created approach on two companies, ExxonMobil and Shell. The original data and the results of the analyses are present in this folder. The folder is further divided in "1 - Communication" and "2 - Lobbying" which describe the applications of the two respective parts of the approach and "3 - Greenwashing table" which contains the table that presents all the results of the two previous parts in a way that allows for a greenwashing appraisal.

There are further README.md that describes the particular sections of this repository.
